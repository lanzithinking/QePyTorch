    "## Setting up the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The next cell demonstrates the most critical features of a user-defined q-exponential process model in QPyTorch. Building a QEP model in QPyTorch is different in a number of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "First in contrast to many existing QEP packages, we do not provide full QEP models for the user. Rather, we provide *the tools necessary to quickly construct one*. This is because we believe, analogous to building a neural network in standard PyTorch, it is important to have the flexibility to include whatever components are necessary. As can be seen in more complicated examples, this allows the user great flexibility in designing custom models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most QEP regression models, you will need to construct the following QPyTorch objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **QEP Model** (`qpytorch.models.ExactQEP`) -  This handles most of the inference.\n",
    "1. A **Likelihood** (`qpytorch.likelihoods.QExponentialLikelihood`) - This is the most common likelihood used for QEP regression.\n",
    "1. A **Mean** - This defines the prior mean of the QEP.(If you don't know which mean to use, a `qpytorch.means.ConstantMean()` is a good place to start.)\n",
    "1. A **Kernel** - This defines the prior covariance of the QEP.(If you don't know which kernel to use, a `qpytorch.kernels.ScaleKernel(qpytorch.kernels.RBFKernel())` is a good place to start).\n",
    "1. A **MultivariateQExponential** Distribution (`qpytorch.distributions.MultivariateQExponential`) - This is the object used to represent multivariate q-exponential distributions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### The QEP Model\n",
    "  \n",
    "The components of a user built (Exact, i.e. non-variational) QEP model in QPyTorch are, broadly speaking:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An `__init__` method that takes the training data and a likelihood, and constructs whatever objects are necessary for the model's `forward` method. This will most commonly include things like a mean module and a kernel module.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A `forward` method that takes in some $n \\times d$ data `x` and returns a `MultivariateQExponential` with the *prior* mean and covariance evaluated at `x`. In other words, we return the vector $\\mu(x)$ and the $n \\times n$ matrix $K_{xx}$ representing the prior mean and covariance matrix of the GP. \n",
    "\n",
    "This specification leaves a large amount of flexibility when defining a model. For example, to compose two kernels via addition, you can either add the kernel modules directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.covar_module = ScaleKernel(RBFKernel() + LinearKernel())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can add the outputs of the kernel in the forward method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "covar_x = self.rbf_kernel_module(x) + self.white_noise_module(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest likelihood for regression is the `qpytorch.likelihoods.QExponentialLikelihood`. This assumes a homoskedastic noise model (i.e. all inputs have the same observational noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other options for exact QEP regression, such as the [FixedNoiseQExponentialLikelihood](https://qpytorch.readthedocs.io/en/stable/likelihoods.html#fixednoiseqexponentiallikelihood), which assigns a different observed noise value to different training inputs."

    "The most obvious difference here compared to many other QEP implementations is that, as in standard PyTorch, the core training loop is written by the user. In QPyTorch, we make use of the standard PyTorch optimizers as from `torch.optim`, and all trainable parameters of the model should be of type `torch.nn.Parameter`. Because QEP models directly extend `torch.nn.Module`, calls to methods like `model.parameters()` or `model.named_parameters()` function as you might expect coming from PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, the boilerplate code below will work well. It has the same basic components as the standard PyTorch training loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Zero all parameter gradients\n",
    "2. Call the model and compute the loss\n",
    "3. Call backward on the loss to fill in gradients\n",
    "4. Take a step on the optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "However, defining custom training loops allows for greater flexibility. For example, it is easy to save the parameters at each step of training, or use different learning rates for different parameters (which may be useful in deep kernel learning for example)."
